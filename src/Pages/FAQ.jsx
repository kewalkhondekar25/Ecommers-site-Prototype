                        <p>Be kind to yourself, take it slow, and enjoy the process. Learn as much as you can,
                            and tackle one new thing at a time so as to not overwhelm yourself. Start small. Consider starting
                            to replace your cow's milk with oat, soy, or almond milk. Then consider swapping out dairy yogurt for
                            plant-based yogurts. Luckily, there are many plant-based meat and dairy alternatives on the market.
                            It can also help if you find plant-based versions of recipes you already enjoy.
                            It also helps to think of all of the ingredients and delicious foods you are adding to meals and snacks,
                            rather than focusing on what you are taking away.</p>
